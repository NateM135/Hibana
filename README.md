# [WIP] Hibana

A simple WIP hacked client created using the Fabric API.

This project was originally created for a Cyber@UCR general meeting. I'm going to continue making this because it's fun to "reverse engineer" how Minecraft works and make these modifications.

Current Client Version: `0.1.2`

Current Supported MC Version: `1.20.4`

## Current Features:
- XRay
- Player Fly
- Boat Fly
- Fullbright
- AutoFish (Sound-Based)
- AutoRespawn
- AutoFish (Entity-Based)
- Specialized Voice Acting for a few modules

## Planned Features (I think these would be fun to implement):
- AutoFarm
- AutoFish (Entity-Based)
- In-Game Mod Menu
- Discord RPC
- Kill Aura
- Scaffold
- Various ESP mods (chest, entity, etc)

## Planned Improvements
- Improve Flying experience (it works but turning isn't smooth)
- Improve Flying speed
- Remove sounds (the build size is kinda ridiculous but the sounds are fun)
- Make XRay work with Fluids, other blocks
