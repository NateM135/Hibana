# Hibana

A simple hacked client created using the Fabric API.

This project was originally created for a Cyber@UCR general meeting. I'm going to continue making this because it's fun to "reverse engineer" how Minecraft works and make these modifications.

## Current Features:
- XRay
- Player Fly
- Entity Fly
- Specialized Voice Acting for each "Module"

## Planned Features:
- Fullbright
- AutoFarm
- In-Game Menu
